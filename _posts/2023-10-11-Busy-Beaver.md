## Mathematical proof that Human-Augmented AI beats lone AI

Once upon a time, it was believed that a computer could never beat the top players in chess. Today chess programs are so advanced that when they go head to head, assisstance from the top players is completely irrelevant.

As this <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/computers-beating-humans-at-advanced-chess-2013-11">business insider</a> link posits, do all tasks have the same fate? Will we eventually get to the point where humans are completely unnecessary for all tasks?

I've seen many opinion posts arguing one way or another. It is probably true that for many tasks, AI will eventually be good enough to not require humans. But below I'll present a simple, well-defined problem, where human + AI will always outperform a lone AI.

This is not an important problem by any means. But asking yourself _why_ a normal human is always able to add value in this problem is worth pondering.
