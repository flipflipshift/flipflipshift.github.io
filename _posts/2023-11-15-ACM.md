## How an increase in all-cause-mortality impacts lifespan

In college, I went to the gym in an attempt to fit the stereotypical mold of "skinny kid gets super huge in college" and consequentially injured myself multiple times through overtraining and training stupidly. Earlier this year, I decided to get back into working out with more of a "longetivity" perspective.

That's how I landed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0pRAqiUJU">this video</a>. Here's an excerpt:

Attia: "So smoking, how much does smoking increase your risk of all-cause mortality? And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM or all-cause mortality is it's really agnostic to how you die. And that doesn't always make sense. I mean, if you're talking about a very specific intervention like a anti-cancer therapeutic, you really care about cancer-specific mortality or heart-specific mortality. But when we talk about these sort of broad things, we like to talk about ACM. So using smoking, smoking is approximately a 40% increase in the risk of ACM."

Huberman: "What does that translate to? And that means I'm shortening my life by 40%?

Attia: "No, it means at any point in time, there's a 40% greater risk that you're gonna die relative to a non-smoker and a never-smoker."

Huberman: "Got it."

Attia: "So it's important to distinguish. It doesn't mean your lifespan is gonna be 40% less. It means at any point in time standing there, your risk of death is 40% higher. And by the way, that'll catch up with you, right? At some point, that catches up. High blood pressure, it's about a 20 to 25% increase in all-cause mortality. You take something really extreme like end-stage kidney disease. So these are patients that are on dialysis waiting for an organ. And again, there's a confounder there because what's the underlying condition that leads you to that? It's profound hypertension, significant type 2 diabetes that's been uncontrolled. That's enormous. That's about 175% increase in ACM. So the hazard ratio is like 2.75. Type 2 diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well. So a 25% increase."

I have no idea which of these statements are true and which are less certain, but that's a pretty interesting mathematical definition.
