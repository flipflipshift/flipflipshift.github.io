## A paradox in conditional expectation

Which of the following do you think is bigger?

A: The expected number of rolls of a fair die until you roll 100 6s in a row, given that all rolls were even

B: The expected number of rolls of a fair die until you roll the 100th 6, given that all rolls are even.

I asked this on r/math a couple weeks ago, and even with the hint that the answer was paradoxical, the early consensus was that 'A' must be larger. The justification was more or less the following: any time you roll until reaching 100 6s in a row, you will have _also_ hit your 100th 6. So regardless what the conditions are, 'A' cannot be smaller than 'B'.

But the correct answer is actually 'B', by a large margin. In fact, even if we replace 'B' with "the expected number of rolls of a fair die until you roll the 70th 6, given that all rolls are even.", it's _still_ bigger.

What on earth is going on?
